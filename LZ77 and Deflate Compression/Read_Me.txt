Running the Project

The person who will use the project must add the text that he or she wants to compress into the project file.

After adding it, it is necessary to enter the code and enter the name of the file with the extension in the fopen section (lines 333 and 108).

The first time the code is run it gives the result of LZ77 compression.

To see the result of the deflate algorithm, the code must be run a second time.

The reason it is run for the second time is that we create the Huffman output to complete the Deflate and add this output to the compression algorithm again, so the terminal must be closed and the code must be run again.

It is the size of the Huffman state of the given file, specified as the original size in the second line on the terminal screen.

The project is written in C language and on the CodeBloks platform.
